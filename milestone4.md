# UI Changes
Since Milestone 3, we have worked to integrate the survey questions and selection/evaluation pages as well. With these added inputs, we needed consistent UI that denoted which options were chosen. As such, we have updated these UI pages as well as worked to keep consistent type buttons and elements throughout.<br><br>Next, we will work to realign the elements that have been moved when adding other HTML elements, and finally integrate our animations.

# User Actions
<b>Feed Coco!</b>: To feed coco, the client must complete the evaluations that the therapist assigned to them.  All of their responses are added to our firebase database, which we use on the therapist side of the app to track how the kids are doing.<br>

<b>Change client evaluations</b>: Instead of having one long evaluation with questions of various topics, we have 7 different evaluations that the therapist can choose from to assign to the client.  This allows the therapist to choose evaluations that cater to each client.<br>

<b>Add client</b>: The therapist can create an account for a new client where they will be prompted to enter the client's information and assign them evaluations.  The new client will be added as a 'user' in our firebase database, added to the therapist's client list and can now login into their account with their username.<br>

<b>Recommend doctor</b>: If the therapist feels that a client needs additional help that they cannot provide, they can use this feature to find someone to recommend.  The therapist chooses which specialty they need for their client and we utilize the BetterDoctors API to provide a list of people in that specialty for them to recommend to their client.<br>

<b>Create a therapist account</b>: On the home page, the therapist will either sign
in or create a new therapist account.  When they create an account, they will be
added as a 'user' to our firebase database, and can then sign in with their username.
