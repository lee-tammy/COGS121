# App Idea
We have decided to keep the same app idea of creating a mental health tracker for children (aged 4-10) and their occupational therapists.  The incentive for the children to return to our app is to make sure that their virtual pet remains healthy and fed.  Their pet will become hungry each day meaning the child needs to answer the set of well-being questions again, and by answering them, they will effectively feed their pet.  The childrenâ€™s responses to these questions will be saved and made available for the therapist to keep track of and interpret.
