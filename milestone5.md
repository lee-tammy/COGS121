# Scenario of Target User Population
<b>Primary Target User Population:</b> Therapists treating 8-year-old to 11-year-old children.<br>
<br><b>Secondary Target User Population:</b> 8-year-old to 11-year-old children.<br>
<br>Stacy is a therapist for a 10-year-old girl named Alex who moved from Los Angeles, CA to San Jose, CA. According to Alex's parents, Alex had changing moods and refuses to talk to them about school even though they received complaints about her behavior. After a few weeks of meeting Alex, Stacy is having trouble getting her to talk about her new school and would sit there looking at the clock as the time passes by. By searching ways to help children express themselves, Stacy found the Aminals web-application catered toward therapists where they can monitor their clients' relationships, moods, and activities. Seeing this as a potential solution to get Alex to talk, she made an account for herself and Alex. After a few weeks of using the web-application, Stacy was able to find out that Alex was being bullied in school and blackmailed. Therefore, Stacy made the necessary actions to help Alex by seeking other experts to help her problem at school.<br>

# UI Changes
Since Milestone 4, we have done the following UI changes:
1. Got rid of a webpage named "client-status.html" and moved the information from that webpage to another webpaged named "client-profile.html".
2. Realigned any off center elements throughout the entirety of the UI
3. Added custom icons for different lists in the surveys and evaluations. 
4. Fix the UI for the webpage named "doc-search.html" for the dropdown menu and table.
5. Fix the evaluation lists to make it more aesthetics.
6. Create the final survey questions for the data visualizations.
7. Implement data visualization of client status (explained more in "Data Visualizations").
