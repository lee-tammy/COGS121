## Project Proposal
For our COGS 121 project, we thought to work on a web application focusing on the target 
user population of children (aged 4-10) and occupational therapists. Today, there are many 
applications designed for mental well-being, specifically to evaluate mental health trends 
on a daily or monthly basis for users. Generally, a mental health tracker application will 
contain a set of prompts that users must fill out or answer every day or every week, so the 
application can create an accurate diagnostic or evaluation of the individual’s current mental 
health capacity. This can then be used in conjunction with a therapist to better help evaluate 
the patient/individual. While this is extremely helpful, these applications generally don’t 
target children. Children tend to have shorter attention spans, and can become bored with answering the same types of questions each day. Furthermore, some of these applications are too sophisticated in terms of vocabulary and such for it to be effective on a child of a lesser age than 10.  Our application looks to solve these issues, by making an application that is more interactive for the children, and better suited to their reading and comprehension capacity. To make it more interactive, we will draw inspiration from other types of games that encourages the target user, in this case a child,  to return each day to the medium. Two examples of this are Tamagotchis and Neopets, where children will return frequently to the application to make sure that their virtual pet is healthy and fed. We wish to also incorporate a “virtual pet” into our app, where the pet will become hungry whenever the child will need to answer the set of questions again. By answering the questions, they will effectively feed the pet as well. This information will then be generated into easy to read graphs and charts that a therapist can keep track of and utilize to decide when another session with the child is necessary. We will likely utilize APIs to help generate these easy to read charts, as well as possible animation ones to help design our virtual pet. None of our teammates are of the same age as a child, nor are any of them licensed therapists, so it’s a valid idea for the project theme of designing for people very different from the individuals on our team.

## Storyboard #1
This storyboard is about a therapist who wants to help her young patients more effectively and finds an app to her do that.
